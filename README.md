# kervolutionalNN

Convolutional neural networks are the current state of the art solution for the problem of image classification.A novel approach in the traditional 
successful CNN is proposed,that uses a projection to higher dimensions using the kernel trick.

### Intuition
The simple convolution operation in 2d,has two equal sized windows , multiplied element-wise and sum up the individual results.
In the image below,the blue 3x3 corner in the left matrix,is convoluted with the 3x3 matrix in the middle to produce the result 51,in the right matrix
